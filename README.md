#Superbowl Redux
##by Jake Rohr

Here's my simulation of the last play of Superbowl XLIX between the Seahawks and the Patriots. 

My initial commit ran through a while loop for each down until the game is over using alerts to give the play by play. I have swapped the alerts for click events but the while loop no longer works. I have swapped in an If statement which works for the first down but the play results seem to stack and run all at once for subsequent downs.
